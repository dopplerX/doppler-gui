## Building Doppler Wallet

### On *nix:

Ubuntu/Debian Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, Boost 1.55 or later, and Qt 5.9 or later.

You may download them from:

- http://gcc.gnu.org/
- http://www.cmake.org/
- http://www.boost.org/
- https://www.qt.io

>> Alternatively, it may be possible to install them using a package manager.

>> To acquire the source via git and build the release version, run the following commands:

```
cd ~

sudo apt-get install build-essential git cmake libboost1.58-all-dev qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools

git clone https://github.com/dopplerX/doppler-gui.git doppler-gui

cd doppler-gui

mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
The executable is now in the build directory.

For a faster build, you can add -jX to the end of the make instruction, where X is the number of threads to use. Example: `make -j8`, for 4 cores with 2 threads each.

You may also want to run `make clean` after to remove the build files, which are all stored under the build directory.


### On Windows:
Dependencies: MSVC 2015 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, and Boost 1.59, and Qt 5.9 or later. You may download them from:

- http://www.microsoft.com/
- http://www.cmake.org/
- http://www.boost.org/
- https://www.qt.io

To build, change to the directory where this file is located, and run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```
And then open and build the generated solution file, located in the build directory, with Visual Studio.

The above commands are for 64 bit Windows. If you are running 32 bit, simply leave off the "Win64". Example: 'cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015".
Be sure to change the version number and year to the version of Visual Studio that you will be using for compiling. 
It may also be possible to build with other compilers, like MinGW.

## Building Packages:
To build a DEB file, from the directory with this file, run:
```
make package-deb
```

To build an RPM file, from the directory with this file, run:
```
make package-rpm
```

To build an OS X DMG, from the directory with this file, run:
```
